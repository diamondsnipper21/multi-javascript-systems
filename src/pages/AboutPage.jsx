                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    The goal of <strong>100 JS Projects</strong> is simple: to
                    help developers enhance their JavaScript skills by building
                    projects that challenge, teach, and inspire. We believe that
                    hands-on experience is the best way to learn, and with each
                    project, you'll dive deeper into the language, learning
                    everything from basic DOM manipulation to advanced
                    JavaScript concepts.
