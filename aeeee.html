                            platform dedicated to mastering JavaScript through
                            practical, real-world projects. Whether you’re a
                            beginner looking to strengthen your foundation or a
                            seasoned developer aiming to expand your JavaScript
                            expertise, this project series has something for
                            everyone.

                        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                        <p>
                            The goal of <strong>100 JS Projects</strong> is
                            simple: to help developers enhance their JavaScript
                            skills by building projects that challenge, teach,
                            and inspire. We believe that hands-on experience is
                            the best way to learn, and with each project, you'll
                            dive deeper into the language, learning everything
                            from basic DOM manipulation to advanced JavaScript
                            concepts.
                        </p>

                            targets specific skills or concepts, and by the time
                            you’re done, you’ll be equipped with the confidence
                            and experience to tackle any JavaScript challenge
                            thrown your way.
